# Collect_Japanese_Text
The Python script is designed to automatically collect all Japanese text from a series of JSON files located in a specified folder.

Save this modified Python script to a file, e.g., collect_japanese_text.py.
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the folder where collect_japanese_text.py is saved.
Run the script with the following command:
bash
Copy code
python collect_japanese_text.py "path_to_folder"
This should generate all_japanese_text.txt in the specified directory, just like before, but now you can easily run it on any folder. Would you like to know more about any part of this?
